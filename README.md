This repository stands as supplementary materials for the publications "New rolling horizon optimization approaches to balance short-term and long-term
decisions: an application to energy planning" and "Techno-economic modelling of local energy systems by mathematical programming: what impact of operational modelling choices?".

The published scripts are use to compute the cost functions as defined in the publications. They can not be used directly because the computations ultimately rely on the in-house PERSEE software from the LSET laboratory in CEA. Still, authors hope this can help to clarify the methodology if the need occurs.
